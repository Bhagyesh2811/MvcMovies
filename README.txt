TASK 1:
I set up Visual Studio as part of this task, and then I created an MVC (model-view-controller) project in line with the course. 
I had no difficulties with this work at all.


TASK 2:

In order to complete the second assignment, I had to review each step from the URL I was given while adding controllers to Visual Studio. 
I found it to be helpful and picked up a lot of new knowledge.
I encountered problems getting the code to run while configuring the controllers.

TASK 3:

I'm working on this assignment, which involves adding a view to the project. 
It was difficult, and I made a lot of mistakes, but if I carefully read the tutorial's instructions,
I can add a view to the project, and the output is accurate and correct as promised.

TASK 4: -

For this assignment, I created a number of files in the view. In views/shared/_Layout.cshtml, I modified the title, footer, and menu link to display a different word in the browser tab. 
There is Privacy Policy - Movie App instead of Privacy Policy - MvcMovie. 
Following that, the _viewstart.cshtml file's content was modified.Next, I
modified the index.cshtml file for the view such that the page's title was something like "My Movie List." 

TASK 5: -

I created a file in views/Helloworld named welcome.cshtml just for this job. 
I created it using the viewdata dictionary and then submitted it to the view. 
The information is subsequently sent as HTML to the viewer via the view.


TASK 6: -

I added a class to the models folder as part of this operation, which I named Movie.cs. 
The movie class contains an ID field, which the database needs in order to build the primary key. 
The controllers folder should then have a newly scaffolded object.

TASK 7: -

I was able to create the project's Migration file while working on this assignment by doing the following: 
From the tools option, I first choose the NuGet Package Manager. I then proceeded to the package management console. 
I kept running into a lot of problems, but eventually the code worked by following the tutorial's step-by-step instructions. 
I finally turned on the app and clicked on the Movie App option.

Because I neglected to enter a command in the package management interface, I'm having problems with NuGet Packet management. 
Next, I present the identical error that the instruction showed. 
Lastly, use the most recent update command to fix the issue.

TASK 9: -

I started utilizing a database. I uploaded a movie to the website's database and made a new class called SeedData in the Models folder.
I added new code from the lesson to the program. I first made a few blunders, but ultimately I got the code file that was error-free.

TASK 10: - 

For the project, I made a GitHub repository. I updated the website with controller methods and views for the most recent project.
In order to do this, I added some lines to the Movie.cs file that I had previously generated in the Models folder. 
These lines tell the program what to show for the field name, like an error in data type for names and ratings.
